	<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
	I have been working on and with computers since the age of 10. My first experience was at school (grade 3), where I learned how to make simple programs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">Apple's Hypercard</a>. It sparked a huge desire to get into what is now a much more sophisticated and involved way of generating content on computers. From there I started learning the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)">Delphi</a> followed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. All of these languages were great and provided an outlet for me to explore how to make things happen on the computer but not a single one of the was exactly what I was looking for as an outlet. I wanted to be able to do anything. Thes only allowed me limited interaction (as far as I could tell at the time) with users on a large scale. I was growing up in the early days of the internet and my modem (yes modem, first a 2400 baud then I moved later to a 14.4kbps modem) was not exactly up to large scale connections, and we were poor, so no internet except at school. I decided to lay own my keyboard and try other things.<br>
	This would have been fine if it weren't for all the times since then that I have said to myself, why can't I just make something to do X thing? I decided 5 years ago to try to get back into computers and it has been quite an informative time, in the years (~10 yrs) I had spent away from computers many things had improved, languages developed and changed and it was all available at my fingertips, online and easy to access.<br>
	One of those languages that had improved vastly over that time period was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> (a collection of lanuages). This I discovered was my perfect medium. It's able to generate fantastic content with relative ease compared to many of the popular languages available and with a worldwide audience it was everythign I hoped for. It was time to dig in and learn.<br>
	My first website was a complete flop. I had decided to create a website to show off all the special pictures collected by the bar owner I worked for. She liked it but it was not responsive, it had terrible bloat (no compression on hundreds of pictures) and made a complete mockery of the idea that I knew what I was doing. Yes I was dissapointed, but I didn't give up, I decided if I have no idea how to do this there has go to be someone to learn from. Enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a> and the programming books and any other resource I could get my hands on. I checked out several but the one I settled on due to the reviews and the low cost was <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>.<br>
	The benefit to this MOOC over many others were the code reviews. Actual people checking the code to make sure it worked and followed guidlines for style and formatting. Combined with this the projects offered along the way were designed to teach you how to look for answers for questions about how to do the projects from very little structure to full fledged end result. Nothing is worse when trying to learn than someone just writing your code for you.<br>
	I enrolled in the Front End Nanodegree program and spent 6 months learning the intricaies of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, and can finally say I have graduated. I can't say it wasn't a struggle at times to get things to work, trial and error were my best friends and still are, but I believe that this is a great way to learn. If you are looking for a great place to learn how to code check them out.<br>

	<h3>Tings I think about</h3>
  So I have been thinking about a lot of things. I think about my 3 lovely boys. I think about the websites I build and how to improve them. I spend a lot of time thinking aboout the games I play. Recently I bought Fallout New Vegas... and I am not even taking the time to enjoy it. I like playing Skyrim but I haven't even been spending anytime playing that either. The one that has always captured my attention is Eve Online which I play religiously. Yesterday I had too much free time so I spent the better part of the afternoon and into the evening mining for ore that I will be using to build spaceships to get them blown up which makes me very happy.

	This is one of my adventures in Eve: https://youtu.be/xqAnBiiGKu0 it was when I came back to the game after a month away from it.

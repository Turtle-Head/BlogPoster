  <h2>Getting started with Google Maps</h2>
  It is super easy to get started with Google Maps. The first thing to do is go over to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Maps Javascript API</a> and get a Key. You'll need the Key to do place searches and a few other things so it's best to have it handy before starting.<br>
  To create a Google Maps data request you'll need jQuery for it's AJAX import method. The best way to get it is by using a CDN to keep the file up to date. You can find one at <a href="http://code.jquery.com/" target="_blank">code.jQuery.com</a>.<br>
  In your html file create a map div.<br><br><div class="code_box">    &lt;div id="map"&gt;&lt;/map&gt;</div><br>

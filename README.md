This started as an experiment, could I add pages dynamically based on links clicked?

The Nav menu has several links almost all load a html doc to the container tag for them as I had originaly planned.

## To add content

-   Add an item to the Articles object in the blogger.js file
-   Create the html document to add, making sure to just use regular within body elements to avoid breakage
